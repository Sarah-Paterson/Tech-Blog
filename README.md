# Social Network API

## Description

In this project, I worked to create a CMS-style blog site. I was motivated to create a blog site that has posts with comments for a shared user experience.

This application was created so that a user could login and contribute to the conversation. If you are not interested in creating an account, the posts and comments are still available to be viewed. This CMS-style blog site follows the MVC paradigm, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and uses the express-session npm package for authentication.

[Here is a link to the live application](https://murmuring-mountain-58427-843ecaf8140c.herokuapp.com/)!

## Usage

The usage of this application is similar to any other blog site. 

### Homepage
On the homepage, there are multiple posts created by users and comments on those posts. If you’re logged out, you don’t have access to add a post or comments.

### Create an Account
In order to contribute to the conversation, an account needs to be created
![Create Account](assets/signup.png "Create Account")

### Login
If you’ve already created an account, use the login to return to the conversation.
